# Faulty-Calculator-
This is a faulty calculator which I made using JavaScript only and 10% of the time it makes mistake.

This make mistakes only 10% of the time, In the time of mistakes it just swapped the buttons, addition become multiplication and so on.
It takes me a whole day to understand its logic and how to do that all because in Python it's just as easy as you think but in Javascript it takes a lot of time.
Although 90% of time it is right but 10% of the time it is the faulty as hell Maybe it's on you, to how you use it.
Hope you're not using this calculator in exams Maybe you can use it to prank your friends Just don't tell me that I made it ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
